      description: "Our dear Dad, we are so pleased and enriched that you and Mother gave us life and everything we needed to thrive. We had so much fun through many stages! We respect your faith, faithfulness to marriage and family, church, community & endless generosity…to the very end of your life! 
The many successes and work ethics in farming and agri-business and willingness to struggle against some of life’s toughest challenges are almost incomprehensible!  You have believed theologically in God, know about & loved Jesus and the Holy Bible, relied on the ever present Holy Spirit to impress you and any others who ask - about direction, resilience, with comfort and the graces to confess and repent when wrong. What a legacy you’ve given to the five developing generations alive in your 97+ years. We and our varied communities will never forget you and be in deep gratitude for your generosity and example. 


Enjoy Present Heaven with Jesus, the saints and Mother! We are so excited to believe & trust that one day there will be New Heavens and Earth and all things and peoples will be at Peace & perfect Shalom!  We may just see you and Mother before that Everlasting Kingdom…who knows??!!   


Your daughter, Marsha Smith Lyvers  


Son-in-law, Joseph M. Lyvers"

      description: "I met Clyde when I was an insurance agent handling his farm’s insurance during the 80’s and 90’s. He would come into our office to discuss business. His visits were the highlight of my day. He never failed to tell me how much he respected and appreciated the roles women play in our society. He would tell of the respect and love he had for his mother and his wife. He said God made women because He knew they would handle so many more tasks and be there to support and guide the men. He said “ women can just naturally handle so many more things.” At the time I knew Clyde, I was a young widow raising three young children and worked full time in a job where I often felt unappreciated. Clyde so lifted my spirits! What a wonderful man he was. I have always remembered him and although he is no longer here with us; I am sure he made a lasting impression on everyone who knew him in life. Go with God Clyde and see your precious Bonnie and your mother again."
